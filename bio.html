            Jeroen van Bart is an Amsterdam based painter. His work can best be described as symbolic surrealism. 
            He communicates his message thru the medium of oilpaint, but he loves for people to not blindly accept 
            his message but rather find their own meaning in his paintings. He is absulutely fascinated by both creating images out of stories 
            as by creating stories out of images. Every element in his paintings has a deeper meaning and nothing is left to coincidence.
            <br>
            <br>
            Born in 1983 in Utrecht Jeroen van Bart was raised in a Cristian family. His upbringing is still very present in his work today, 
            since in most of his works he winks at biblical stories and themes.
            <br>
            Drawing is something that comes natural to him, his notebooks at school contained more drawings than letters, 
            but he never thaught about artschool at an early age. At the age of 16 he started working and at a later age he went back to school to study marketing 
            and communication. 
            In 2017 at the age of 34 due to physical problems he had to quit spending 6 nights a week on sports and in his search for purpose he came to painting as a new outlet. 
            At this moment he picked up a cheap canvas and acrylic paint and started his painting journey.

            After experimenting with different materials, techniques and lots of recearch and selfstudy Jeroen van Bart enroled in an art education at the Wackers Academie in 2020 
            were he is presently still a student. 
            This classical education thought him a lot about the basics of composition, values and drawing techniques. In 2020 he also followed a 
            webdevelopment course that resulted in him being able to create this website by writing the code himself.

            For making a painting Jeroen van Bart follows a few logical steps. At first he researches different images. After finding interesting elements 
            he creates a story that he wants to tell the viewer. For the chosen elements he produces small studies to see how they work in different compositions before making 
            a bigger piece that contains all the elements. During this process the story is still very much under constuction and can still change completely. 
            Established his final story knowing what works and what does not, he starts working on a good canvas creating a better painting than the one he did before. 
            His painting follows 3 simple steps: Shape, Value and Colour.

            Looking at his work Jeroen van Bart does not want the viewer to be poisened by the story he used to create his work. He rather has the viewer looking at his works 
            bringing their own memories and baggage in to the equation. <i> "Based upon experiences in life, people can find different meanings for the same object or element."</i> 
            he perceives it as his biggest accomplishment when people look at his work, think about it and create their own story to fit their life at that moment in time.
