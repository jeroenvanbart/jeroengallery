        <p class="text-block">
          In a time before telephones and the Internet, the Queen of Sheba heard
          stories about the great wisdom of a king far away. One can only
          imagine how stories traveled from one person to the next, changing
          ever so slightly with every new messenger. The Queen of Sheba was well
          aware of this possibility, but her curiosity got the better of her.
          What if these stories were true? What if the king’s wisdom was truly
          unparalleled? What then could they achieve together? She decided she
          had to know and so she embarked on a journey from Ethiopia to Israel
          with all of her riches packed on the backs of her many camels.
          However, with every new day in her journey she began to wonder whether
          she was chasing after a rumour, a whisper. Filled with a growing sense
          of doubt and before giving away all of her treasures, she came up with
          a clever way to test the wisdom of this king: he’d have to solve all
          of her riddles. In the painting you can see her riddles fly in the air
          as pieces of a puzzle as she moves through the desert; but beware:
          Ceci n'est pas Salomon.
